            <p>
               Hello all,  I'm a Developer, I love to create beautiful and functional websites and develop products as many. 
               " Website without visitors is like a ship lost in the horizon ". Mastering programming doesnâ€™t require you to be passionate.
                Programming is a set of computer knowledge and techniques. It comes with experience and practice on different and progressively 
                complex projects. 
               The one thing all successful developers have in common is work Not a passion.
